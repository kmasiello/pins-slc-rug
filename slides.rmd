# What are <img src="slides_files/pins.png" height="90px" style="vertical-align:middle"/> ?
> The [pins package](pins.rstudio.com) publishes data, models, and other R objects, making it easy to share them across projects and with your colleagues.

<br>
This includes:  
data frames, models, .rds objects, JSON, feather files from the Arrow package...

* Do you rely on `read_csv()` to bring in emailed data?  

* Have you lost track of what version is which? *Was it* `dataFINALfinal.csv` *or*  `dataFINALv2.csv`? 🤔

* Do you need to reuse the same data or object across multiple projects or with other people?

* Are you redeploying your app every time the supporting data is updated? 😱

* Not *too* big... a few hundred megabytes is plenty  <br>
👉 if it's too big for Excel, it's too big for a pin

* Ephemeral data or reference tables that don't merit being in a database

* Something that needs to be shared or reused

* Something that can be programatically regenerated

# Schedule updates to your pin
💪 Updates happen outside of the Shiny process  
💪 Dashboard users have fresh data without waiting for the ETL
